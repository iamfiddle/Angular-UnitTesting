# Angular UnitTesting Framework and Code Coverage Reporting

This project is designed and developed to demonstrate angular TDD feature and to show how we can configure our angular project for code coverage through angular CLI, as part of this demonstrate following has been covered:

1) Unit Test framework using Jasmine and Test Runner via Karma 
2) Spec files with generic unit test cases for following-
    -Services
    -HTPT API's 
    -Class's including abstract class's, functions and properties
    -Generic Components having reactive forms approach
3) Code Coverage reports for Teamcity using Istanbull

About TDD Framework:

Two such tools and frameworks that are used when testing Angular is Jasmine and Karma. Jasmine is a JavaScript testing framework that supports a software development practice called Behaviour-Driven Development(BDD). Itâ€™s a specific flavour of Test-Driven Development (TDD).

I have showed following feeatures of Jasmine while writing UT cases:
1. TearUp and Tear Down



Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
